In today’s data-driven digital economy, organizations operate across a wide ecosystem of digital services such as streaming platforms, communication tools, cloud applications, and web-based utilities. Understanding how users allocate their time and attention across these services is critical for optimizing digital strategy, improving user engagement, and prioritizing platform investments.

This project focuses on analyzing real-world digital services usage data to uncover consumption patterns, identify high-engagement platforms, and understand behavioral differences across user segments. By restructuring high-dimensional usage data into an analyzable format, the project enables comparative analysis across services and reveals how user engagement is distributed within the digital ecosystem.

The analysis generates actionable insights by ranking digital services based on usage intensity, identifying concentration of user attention, and comparing consumption behavior across distinct user clusters. These insights demonstrate how usage analytics can be leveraged to support strategic decision-making related to digital service optimization, resource allocation, and data-driven platform prioritization.

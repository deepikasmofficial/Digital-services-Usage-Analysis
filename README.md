In modern digital ecosystems, organizations operate across a wide range of digital services including communication platforms, cloud applications, streaming services, and web utilities. One of the key challenges faced by decision-makers is understanding where user attention is concentrated, how usage is distributed across services, and how different user segments interact with digital platforms at scale.

This project addresses that challenge by performing a comprehensive analysis of digital services usage data to uncover engagement patterns, identify dominant platforms, and segment users based on behavioral similarity. High-dimensional usage data was systematically cleaned, structured, and transformed into an analyzable format to enable meaningful comparison across services and user groups.

The analysis generated measurable outputs including a ranked view of digital service engagement, identification of usage concentration effects, and cluster-level behavioral insights that highlight how consumption patterns vary across user segments. These outputs demonstrate how raw usage data can be converted into actionable intelligence that supports strategic decisions such as digital service prioritization, user segmentation, resource allocation, and optimization of digital offerings.

Overall, the project illustrates the practical application of data analytics in translating large-scale behavioral data into decision-support insights, showcasing how organizations can leverage usage analytics to improve digital strategy and engagement outcomes.
